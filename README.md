# ML-Setup

## Get started with machine learning

1. install [3.6.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. run `python3` in terminal and make sure version matches downloaded version. If it does, type `ctrl D` to exit out of python.

3. run `pip3 install virtualenv` in terminal (pip is the package manager for python).

4. run `virtualenv venv` in terminal to create the virtual environment.

5. run `python` in terminal and make sure version matches downloaded version. If it does, exit out of python.

6. run `source venv/bin/activate` to go into virtual environment (this may take a couple minutes).

7. run `jupyter notebook`, which should open up a jupyter notebook in your browser.

8. On the right side of the page, click on "New" and select "Python 3" under notebook. (To exit out of jupyter type `ctrl c` in terminal followed by `y`).

9. Congrats! You can now do machine learning exploration in jupyter or run your own machine learning scripts.
